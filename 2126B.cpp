    // so jean want to visit as many as park possible 
    // one hike to peak takes exactly k days and during each of these days weather will be goood ai = 0;
    // that is formallly he can start hike on day i only and only if all aj = 0;
    // after each hike she must take break of one day ok :) that means that day she can't go on hike
